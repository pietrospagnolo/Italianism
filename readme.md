# X Italianism 15

ITALIANISM is a creative conference and a meeting space for the new Italian visual arts scene taking place in Rome on October 10th, 2015 (10:00am - 04:00am).
The conference objective is to draw an initial picture of contemporary production: young, original and qualitative and to promote networking and co-operation, whether in Italy or abroad.
The conference values are creative and executive excellence, reputation and capability of competing with international markets. Most recently, a new form of creative thinking and execution has come to light further to an increasing number of talented Italians who are based and work outside of Italy, where their more creative and spontaneous approach meets a more structured and disciplined working methodology. Therefore, rather than referring to ‘Made in Italy’, we have chosen to speak of ‘Made by Italians’, which we find more relevant to this conference.
ITALIANISM originates from the saperevedere.it blog . The inaugural conference is taking place during the 6th edition of the Outdoor Festival, event which brings together youth culture and lifestyle, with the aim of facilitating the development of a contemporary and European way of thinking in the city of Rome, in addition to promoting an opportunity for youths to come along together and enjoy the arts and culture.
Around 100 artists and professionals will be participating, representing a diverse array of disciplines:
Art Direction • Communication • Design • Digital • Photography • Cartoon Design• Graphics • Illustration• Infographics • Multimedia • Print • Street Art • Textiles • Tattoo • Typography • Video.
